Title:  Please provide the title of your project, followed by the names of allteam members.  There should be at least 2 members for each project. Teams may include up to 4 students (special permission can be obtained for a team ofone although there must be a special reason).


Summary:  Summarize  your  project  in  no  more  than  2-3  sentences.   De-scribe what you plan to do and what vision problem you will be working on.Checkfinal  project  ideasfile in cuLearn for suggested project ideas.  You can choose any idea other than these examples.


Background:  If your ideas coming from existing research you should referto the publications and describe what you are doing differently.


Notes:   If  your  project  involves  taking  advantage  of  computational  speedups available  on  your  iOS  device  -  such  as  box  filters,  inverse  composition  in  theLK  algorithm,  NEON  intrinsics,  OpenGL  ES,  Accelerate  Framework,  binarydescriptors such as FAST and BRIEF, etc.  - describe their application and whythey are necessary in more detail.  If your project involves something aroundusing your device in a mobile fashion - for example virtually rendering an objectin your room - then describe what components of your solution are unique to amobile device (the high-speed camera, GPS, IMU, Gyro?).1


The Challenge:  Describe in a few sentences why the problem is challeng-ing.   Could  you  solve  your  problem  using  just  a  few  pre-existing  functions  inOpenCV?  Try  to  state  explicitly  what  you  are  hoping  to  learn  by  doing  thisproject?  A flow chart or visual depiction of what you are trying to do would begood here.


Goals and Deliverables: Describe the deliverables or goals of your project. In  a  couple  of  sentences  separate  your  goals  into  what  you  PLAN  TO ACHIEVE  (what  you  believe  you  must  get  done  to  have  a  successfulproject and get the grade you expect) and an extra goal or two that youHOPE TO ACHIEVE if the project goes really well and you get ahead ofschedule.
Describe what success looks like and how it can be evaluated. For example,if your project is to measure the velocity of a baseball being thrown in frontof an iOS device, how will you validate that it works?  Screen shots of theApp in action?  A speed benchmark run across a variety of videos?  A livevideo of the app in action?  It will NOT be enough to simply provide theXcode project - you will need to provide evidence that you have achievedyour goal.â€¢How realistic is it for your team to get what it needs to get done within theallotted time?  Remember you only have a few weeks to get this projectcompleted.


Schedule:  Produce a schedule for your project.  Your schedule should haveat least one item to do per week per participant.  List what your plan to getdone each week from February 1st until the 10th of April deadline.  You wouldpresent your projects in the class in the last week of the semester.  You shouldhave some results by March 31.


Submission: Submit your proposal in PDF format in cuLearn. The numberof pages should be at least 2 pages and not exceed 5 pag
